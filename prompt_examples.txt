SORASHORTS PROMPT PIPELINE EXAMPLES
===========================================================================

There are 2 stages:
  1. Haiku 4.5 generates 5 scene prompts (storyboard)
  2. Each scene prompt gets a prefix prepended before sending to nano-banana/edit

The prefix (prepended by app.py for EVERY scene):
  "Use the face and appearance of the person in the reference image as the
   male lead character. Keep his face, identity, and features exactly as
   shown in the reference photo. Place them into this scene: {scene_prompt}"

For female users, "male lead" → "female lead", "his" → "her".
